### Welcome! 👋

- 💻 I'm currently working on: implementing a thalamus and cortex model using [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) and [NetPyNE](http://netpyne.org/) to investigate [anesthesia](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.17.480766v1)!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about: advanced Python, functionally-relevant brain oscillations, cortical networks, the list goes on...
- 💬 Ask me about: anything computational neuroscience or simulating the brain! I love talking to people about this.
- 🔭 I'd like to someday: contribute to the Linux Kernel, make an electronic music album, make my own pasta, go vegetarian then vegan, ~~build my own custom keyboard (done!)~~, and many other things.
