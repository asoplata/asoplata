### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ’» I'm currently working on: developing the [Human Neocortical Neurosolver](https://hnn.brown.edu/) software at the [Jones Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/stephanie-r-jones-lab/)!
- Recent work: implementing a thalamus and cortex model using [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) and [NetPyNE](http://netpyne.org/) to investigate [anesthesia](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.17.480766v1), then atlas-based models of mouse thalamus at the [Blue Brain Project](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain/).
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about: advanced Python, functionally-relevant brain oscillations, cortical networks, the list goes on...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: anything computational neuroscience or simulating the brain! I love talking to people about this.
- ðŸ”­ I'd like to someday: contribute to the Linux Kernel, make an electronic music album, make my own pasta, go vegetarian, ~~build my own custom keyboard (done!)~~, and many other things.
